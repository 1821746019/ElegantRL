Muti-level Parallelism
==============================================

ElegantRL}, an open-source massively parallel framework for DRL algorithms implemented in PyTorch. We fully exploit the parallelism of DRL algorithms at multiple levels, including agent parallelism of population-based training \citep{lifeifei_evo, zhou2021malib} and worker-learner parallelism of a single agent \citep{Nair2015MassivelyPM, espeholt2019seed}.
